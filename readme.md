## NES emulator written in Rust

This is currently WIP.

The CPU implementation should be _somewhat_ correct. NESTest passes up through the officially supported instructions (I haven't implemented the unofficial instructions yet).

Parsing and "loading" of iNES version 1 is supported.

Currently working on implementing the PPU.
